Hello ! This code is developed by Arsalan Ghassemi for the Problem Set 1 of CS50's introduction to Computer Science's course.

It checks the credit card number of the user's input and returns if the card is a valid AMEX, MASTERCARD or VISA.

It first checks the length of the credit card number and if it's incorrect it returns "invalid"

Then it checks the credit card number with Luhn's algorithm and returns "invalid" if the result does not match.

Finally it checks the first digits of the credit card to return if the credit card type.

Feel free to send any ameliorations suggestions at contact@arsadevs.com
